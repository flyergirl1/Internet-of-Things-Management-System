# Decentralized Internet of Things (IoT) Management System

A blockchain-based platform for secure, scalable, and autonomous management of IoT devices and their data.

## Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) revolutionizes IoT device management by providing a secure, transparent platform for device registration, data management, automated actions, and maintenance scheduling. Built on blockchain technology, it ensures data integrity and enables trustless device interactions.

## Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contract components:

1. **Device Registration Contract:** Manages IoT device identities
    - Implements unique device identification
    - Controls device permissions and access rights
    - Manages device ownership and transfers
    - Handles device authentication
    - Maintains device specifications and capabilities

2. **Data Contract:** Handles IoT sensor data
    - Manages encrypted data storage
    - Controls data access permissions
    - Implements data sharing protocols
    - Ensures data integrity
    - Handles data retention policies

3. **Action Contract:** Manages automated responses
    - Processes sensor data triggers
    - Executes predefined actions
    - Manages action permissions
    - Handles cross-device coordination
    - Maintains action audit logs

4. **Maintenance Contract:** Tracks device health
    - Monitors device performance metrics
    - Schedules preventive maintenance
    - Tracks maintenance history
    - Manages service provider relationships
    - Handles maintenance verification

## Features

- **Secure Identity:** Blockchain-based device identification
- **Encrypted Data:** End-to-end encryption for sensor data
- **Automated Actions:** Smart contract-driven device responses
- **Predictive Maintenance:** AI-enhanced maintenance scheduling
- **Access Control:** Granular permission management
- **Audit Trail:** Immutable record of device activities
- **Scalable Architecture:** Supports millions of devices
- **Cross-Platform:** Compatible with major IoT protocols
